# Benefits Eligibility Rules - Phase 3

BEARS will be a proactive notification service that provides timely and personalized information about benefits eligibility, contextualized 
by life events. Before we can do notifications and potentially proactive notifications, we need to be able to estimate eligibility and 
figure out a way to get people to sign up and store their information. We also need to establish relationships with benefits programs so 
we can keep eligibility information up to date. 

### The following npm scripts are defined
